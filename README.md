# PaintCalculator
Borwell Software Challenge

This is a program that will get the area of the floor, the amount of paint for the walls, and also the volume of the room from user given input.

Assumptions made: 
  - Room is 1 "square"
    - No "jutting out" areas
  - Room is consistent height
  - Walls require 1 coat of paint
  - Cant have a room less than or equal to 0cm large in any direction
  
Things to add: 
  - Scalable resolution
    - i dont know how to do that :(
  - Nicer formatting somehow
  - Metric Conversions?
  -
